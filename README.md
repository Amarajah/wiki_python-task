# wiki_python-task

The Python script in this repo reads a list of URLs from a CSV file and checks their HTTP status codes using the Python 'requests' library.<br>
If a URL is accessible, its status code will be printed out along with the URL, else, an error message is displayed in place of the HTTP status and this error message indicates the specific type of errror that was met while trying to get the HTTP status code.<br>

Some of the URLs in the test CSV file appear to be broken or outdated and this resulted in errors, so the test CSV file is actually a good example to highlight the codes functionality and see how it works in realtime using real URL examples :)
